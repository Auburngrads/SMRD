\item{git_user}{\code{character} GitHub account username (see details)}

\description{
Create a branding logo for an SMRD app
}
\details{
This function should not be called directly, but is invoked by
         \code{add_options} when an app is rendered.  
         
         By default, the branding logo is the GitHub fontAwesome icon 
         ('fa fa-github'). If \code{img} is specified, it takes precedence
         oven \code{icon}. 
         
         Hovering over the logo will reveal a link to view the code used to 
         create the app. This is helpful in a teaching environment, where 
         students often are interested in understanding how an app functions. 
         The URL for the link is of the form (https://github.com\code{git_user}\code{app_pkg}blob/master/inst/apps)
         where \code{app_pkg} is created dynamically.
