\description{
Samples of carbon-film resistors were tested at each of three levels of temperature. At the standard 
             operating temperature of 50^{o} C, carbon-film resistors will slowly degrade. Changes in resistance 
             can cause reduced product performance or even cause system failures.  The test was run at high levels 
             of temperature to accelerate the chemical degradation process and obtain degradation data more quickly.
             
             This dataset presents the percent change in resistance measured throughout the test, 
             while the \code{\link{resistor2}} dataset presents the absolute value of resistance measure during the test.
