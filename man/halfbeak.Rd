\description{
Ascher and Feingold (1984) present a dataset containing unscheduled maintenance actions for the U.S.S. Halfbeak number 4 main 
             propulsion diesel engine over 25,518 operating hours. For each observation, an event was recorded as either \code{start} 
             (denotes the start of the observational period), \code{end} (denotes the end of the observational period), or \code{report}
             (denoting that an unscheduled maintenance action was reported). The data were analyzed to determine if the system was 
             deteriorating (unscheduled maintenance actions were being reported more frequently as the system ages)
