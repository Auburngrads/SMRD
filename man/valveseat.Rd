\description{
Nelson and Doganaksoy report the age when a valve seat replacement occurred across a fleet of 41 diesel 
             engines. For each engine, the number of days when a replacement event occured were recorded along with the number of 
             days when the observational period ended. The data were recorded to answer the following questions:
             \describe{ 
             {1}{Does the replacement rate increased with age?}
             {2}{How many replacement valves will be needed in some future period of time?}
             {3}{Can valve life in these systems be modeled as a superimposed renewal process?}
             }
