\description{
Nelson and Doganaksoy present data on cylinder replacement times for 120 diesel engines.  
             We take these engines to be a sample from a larger population of engines. Each engine has 16 cylinders.

\details{
Cylinders in a type of diesel engine can develop leaks or have low compression. 
         Cylinders are inspected at times of convenience, along with other usual engine maintenance operations. 
         Faulty cylinders are replaced by a rebuilt cylinder.  More than one cylinder could be replaced at an inspection.  
         Management needed to know if the company should perform preventive replacement of cylinders before they develop 
         low compression failures.
