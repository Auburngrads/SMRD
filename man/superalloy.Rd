\description{
Nelson (1990) presents and analyzes life data from a strain-controlled, low-cycle fatigue test performed on 26 cylindrical 
             specimens of a nickel-base superalloy. Four of the specimens were removed from the test before failure.
             In addition to recording the number of cycles to failure, the level of pseudostress (Young's modulus 
             times strain) was also measured.  The initial purpose of Nelson's analysis was to estimate the curve 
             giving the number of cycles at which .1\% of the population of such specimens would fail, as a function 
             of pseudostress.
