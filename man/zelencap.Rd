\description{
Zelen describes an accelerated life test performed on glass capacitors at higher than usual levels of 
             temperature and voltage. The data were obtained from a factorial experiment in which eight capacitors were tested 
             at each combination of temperature and voltage. For each combination, the test was terminated after the fourth failure
             was observed, yielding failure (Type II) censored data.
