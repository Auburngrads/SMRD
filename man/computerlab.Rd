\description{
A small un-monitored computer laboratory contains 10 networked
             microcomputers. Users who notice a hardware or software problem with
             a computer are supposed to report the problem to a technician who
             will fix the problem.  This data set includes the days in which trouble 
             calls were received, for each computer. Most of the trouble
             reports were easy to address (replace a defective mouse, reboot
             the computer, remake the computer's file system from the server, remove
             stuck floppy disk, tighten loose connector, etc.). All of the computers 
             were in operation for the entire semester (day 1 through 105).
