\description{
Although solid-state electronics have made vacuum tubes obsolete for most applications, such tubes are still 
             widely used in the output stage of high-power transmitters. Davis (1952) presents life data for a certain kind 
             of transmitter vacuum tube (designated as "V7" within a particular transmitter design).  For this dataset, and in 
             many practical situations, the exact failure times were not reported. Instead the data only contain the number of 
             failures observed within each inspection interval.
