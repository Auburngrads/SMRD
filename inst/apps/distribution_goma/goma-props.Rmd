<h3>About the Birnbaum-Saunders Distribution</h3>

- Also known as fatigue life distribution

- If T ~ BISA($\theta$,$\beta$) and c > 0 then cT ~ BISA($c\theta$,$\beta$)

- If T ~ BISA($\theta$,$\beta$) then 1/T ~ BISA($\theta^{-1}$,$\beta$)

- $h(t;\theta, \beta)$ is always unimodal and isn't always increasing

- $h(0;\theta,\beta)=0$

- $lim_{t \to \infty}h(t;\theta,\beta)=1/(2\theta\beta^{2})$

- It has a close relationship to the IGAU distribution

- Similar to the lognormal distribution

- Used to model failure times
