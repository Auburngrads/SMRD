### Figure 3.2

- Figure 3.2 shows a nonparametric plot of $F(t)$ for the Plant 1 Heat Exchanger Data

- The values of $F(1), F(2),$ and $F(3)$ on the plot correspond the values computed above

- Pointwise $95\%$ confidence intervals are also shown on the plot

    + Later, this chapter presents methods to compute pointwise and simultaneous confidence intervals
