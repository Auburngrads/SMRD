### Example 1.8 - Printed Circuit Board ALT Data (Meeker & LuValle, 1995)

- Motivation for the study

    - Relative humidity $\%RH$ affects the time until a short-circuit event in PCB's

    - Failures may be generated more quickly by increasing $\%RH$ 

- Study objectives

    - Drive failures of PCB's at several levels of $RH$
    
    - Use the failure data to determine the proportion of PCB's failing at the "use" humidity

- Data set (Table 1.4) `printedcircuitboard`

    - $n = 70$ PCB's tested at $4$ separate levels of $\%RH$ 

    - The time until a short-circuit was assessed in $4$ or $12$-hour intervals
