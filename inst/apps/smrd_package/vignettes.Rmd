### Package Vignettes

- The original implementation RSplida came with a collection of text files containing example R code   

- The files were broken out by chapter and were aptly named 'echapter1.txt', 'echapter2.txt', etc.

- The code in each of the files allows users to reproduce the results presented in the text and understand how to apply those methods to their own data

- In the SMRD pacakge, these text files are being updated using rmarkdown and made available as interactive HTML vignettes

- Users can now access the vignettes for each chapter simply by calling `vignette('echapter1')`  

    + Vignettes have been created for each chapter in the text 

    + However, as of 1 November 2016 the quality of the some vignettes is far below that of others.
