#' SMRD: Comprehensive Life-Data Analysis in R
#'
#' 
#' @name SMRD
#' @docType package
#' @details Since its publication, the text Statistical Methods for Reliability Data 
#' has been recognized as a foundational resource in analyzing time to event data.  
#' Along with the text, the authors also developed an S-Plus software pacakge, 
#' called SPLIDA, to help readers utilize the methods presented in the text.  Today, R is 
#' is the most popular statistical computing language in the world, largely supplanting
#' S-Plus.  The SMRD package is the result of a multi-year effort to completely rebuild 
#' SPLIDA, to take advantage of the improved graphics and workflow capabilities available
#' in R.  This presentation introduces the SMRD package, outlines the improvements and 
#' shows how the package works seamlessly with the rmarkdown and shiny packages to dramatically
#' speed up your workflow. The presentation concludes with a discussion on what improvements
#' still need to be made prior to publishing the package on the CRAN
